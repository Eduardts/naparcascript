On "code.năps" you have a txt file written in a romanian python-like language, in order to run the code, you must do it by running Năpârcascript.py.
On Linux you can run "python Năpârcascript.py". Minimalist.txt it is the base/source of the Naparcascript.py script, it can be used to change python keywords into any language. 
For now the language was tested only on a file, i didn't make large folders. If you want highlighting you have to move "python.lang" into your language-specs directory.
