On "code.năps" you have a txt file written in a romanian python-like language, in order to run the code, you must do it by running Năpârcascript.py.
On Linux you can run "python Năpârcascript.py". You can also change python keywords into any language. 
For now the language was tested only on a file, i didn't make large folders. If you want highlighting you have to move "python.lang" into your language-specs directory.
